.Sh NAME
.Nm lat2ascii
.Nd transliterates input from UTF-8 Serbian Latin to 7-bit ASCII
.Sh USAGE
.Nm lat2ascii \(lB file ... \(rB
.Sh FUNCTION
.Nm
reads lines of UTF-8 Serbian Latin text from input and writes corresponding lines of 7-bit ASCII text to standard output. This transformation is lossy, as multiple Serbian Latin characters are mapped to each of ASCII characters "c", "s", and "z".

lat2ascii requires AWK with UTF-8 support. It will search the PATH for `gawk'.
